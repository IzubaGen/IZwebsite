                                <br><strong class="theme-color text">[8.2] </strong>The initial project cost invoiced to the Client is for the work agreed upon at the commencement of the contract and/or the project only. Should the Client decide that changes or additions are required as the project is on-going, then we will provide a separate quote and/or invoice explicitly showing the costs for the additional work. This may also require extension of the timescale for completing the project (as explained above in 6.5).
                                <br><strong class="theme-color text">[8.3] </strong>Deployment or launch of the Client's website, app or software may <u>only</u> take place after full payment has been received by IzubaGen from the Client.

Any costs associated with third-party services will be the responsibility of the Client and will be payable by the Client to IzubaGen or the third-party service provider as may be decided by IzubaGen.
                                    <br><span class="theme-color text" style="padding-left:2.5rem;">8.6.2 </span>In the event that additional costs beyond the agreed-upon project scope arise, IzubaGen will seek approval from the Client before proceeding with any work or incurring expenses. The Client understands that failure to approve additional costs may result in delays or limitations to the project.
                                    <br><span class="theme-color text" style="padding-left:2.5rem;">8.6.3 </span>In cases where third-party costs are incurred by IzubaGen on behalf of the Client during the course of the project, the Client agrees to reimburse IzubaGen for all those expenses. This includes but is not limited to expenses related to domain registration, web hosting, aggregators, cloud services, software licenses, and other necessary services.
